Before we dive in, here is a quick code of conduct to keep in mind:

  * **Professionalism** - We prioritize shipping at all costs. Our main goal is to meet deadlines and deliver valuable output in a timely manner. If you commit to a Raid, you should be prepared to do anything and everything to make sure it gets done.

  * **Respect** -  Raid Guild is a no-beef zone, meaning that we do not discriminate and expect you to withhold all judgement while interacting in or with Raid Guild.

  * **Collaboration** - Raid Guild is meant to foster new relationships. Please be open to inviting new members to your Raid as you’re likely to be pleasantly surprised by what you find.

  * **Honor** - Becoming a member of Raid Guild is no easy feat. We ask that all those involved with Raid Guild treat our brand as a seal of honor. This means being kind to others inquiring about the Guild, and speaking favorably about it when presenting on behalf of the Guild in public. If there is something you do not like about the Guild, please vocalize it internally so that we can do our best to resolve it.

  * **Free Speech** - Raid Guild is an idea meritocracy. We invite you to share your opinion. In fact, we encourage contentious opinions so long as they are presented in a constructive manner.


With that, let’s learn about the Raid Guild!
