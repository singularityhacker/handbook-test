To advance from an Apprentice to a Member, you will need to be Championed by an existing Raid Guild Member. Once you find a Champion, there are a few Your champion will need to put down a stake of $RAID tokens. See the [Champion a New Member](./champion-a-member) for how this works.

Once youâ€™ve found a Champion, you are eligible to level up from an Apprentice to a Member - signalled by 100 Shares as opposed to 1. Here's what to do:

Follow the [Proposal Process](./proposal-types) and use the Membership Proposal to request the difference in Shares to get to your 100 Share cap in the [Raid Guild DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xfe1084bc16427e5eb7f13fc19bcd4e641f7d571f). In the description of your proposal, enter a blockscout link to the staking transaction that your Champion gives you. This is how the DAO will validate that your Champion made the appropriate stake.

Please note that all new members are capped at 100 Shares for 500 wxDAI.

Once your proposal has passed and been processed, you'll now have 100 Shares and full membership in Raid Guild!

To get access to member-exclusive channels in the Raid Guild [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Z2PMbXN), head to the <span class='channels'>#member-join</span> channel and enter the `!join` command. Then follow the CollabLand instructions to get your `@Raid Guild Member` role. Now you're ready to [join a raid](./join-a-raid)!

1. Successfully join at least 1 [raid](./join-a-raid) or [RIP](./rips). This include raids or RIPs completed within the first 60 days as well as raids or RIPs still in progress (provided that you are in good standing on that project).
2. Attend at least 2 [Guild meetings](./community-meetings), including Roundtable and Raider Rally.
3. Demonstrate shared values with the Guild (at the discretion of the DAO).
